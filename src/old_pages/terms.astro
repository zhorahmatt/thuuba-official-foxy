				Understanding these limitations helps you know the extent of our responsibilities and your
				rights.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="basic-text">
			<h4>General Limitations</h4>
			<p>
				Foxi is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not warrant that the service
				will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. We disclaim all warranties, whether
				express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability,
				fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are not liable for any damages resulting from the use or inability to use our services,
				including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
				punitive damages. This includes damages for loss of profits, data, or other intangibles.
			</p>

			<h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
			<p>
				Foxi may include links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled
				by us. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites,
				information, materials, products, or services. Accessing and using these third-party
				services is at your own risk.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are not liable for any loss or damage incurred as a result of any dealings with
				third-party websites or services, including the sharing of your information with such third
				parties. It is your responsibility to review the terms and conditions and privacy policies
				of any third-party websites or services you use.
			</p>

			<h4>Maximum Liability</h4>
			<p>
				In no event shall our total liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to
				the use of or inability to use the service exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for
				accessing Foxi during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of the claim.
				This limitation applies regardless of the form or source of the claim or loss, whether such
				liability arises out of any claim based upon contract, warranty, tort, or otherwise.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential
				or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. In such cases, our
				liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
